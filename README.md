This is my project created after completing the Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification course ðŸ¥³ <br>

# Rules
To win the game a user must set  all numbers in this correct pattern:<br>
`123` <br>
`456` <br>
`78` <br>

Numbers can be moved by putting them on the empty place. <br>
A user can choose one number from numbers around the empty place and type it. <br>
Then the number will change its place. <br>
